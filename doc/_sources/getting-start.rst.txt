What is Rangers Protocol
==========================


Rangers Protocol is a Metaverse blockchain infrastructure. It is a high-performance engine for complex development and data migration. Rangers Protocol is fully compatible with Ethereum, professionally supports NFT and complex applications, and integrates and expands cross-chain, NFT, EVM, and distributed network protocols.


Introduction of Consensus Mechanism
=====================================


Rangers Protocol's consensus mechanism process can be briefly described as follows: ::
- ``Proposal Process：`` The proposal nodes shall calculate whether they are eligible for the candidate blocks at regular intervals. If qualified, package the transaction to generate a candidate block. Meanwhile, according to the random number generated by this candidate block, select the verification group and submit the candidate block.
 ::
- ``Verification Process:`` After the nodes in the verification group receive the candidate blocks, they will verify the verification of the candidate blocks. For the verified candidate blocks, the verification nodes will broadcast the signing of verification in the verification group. While for those invalid candidate blocks, they don't send any messages. After the nodes in the verification group collect the specified threshold verification signatures, restore the signatures of the verification group. After formal blocks are generated with the signatures of the verification group, they will be broadcast to the whole network.
 ::
- ``Broadcasting and Network-Wide Verification:`` After all the nodes receive formal blocks, they will make verifications of blocks. Meanwhile, the node needs to judge and handle the soft fork after verification due to the possibility of concurrency between the proposed candidate blocks and generated formal blocks. The node will store the blocks to the local device through the above procedures.

Introduction of Tokenomics
==============================

Rangers Protocol designed Rangers Protocol Gas (RPG for short) as an infrastructure token with a total supply of 21 million pieces. Ecological nodes that generate blocks are divided into proposal and verification nodes. This system adopts an open participation mechanism, allowing all users to participate in the system’s operation.


RPG will circulate among users, developers, investors, and ecological nodes. For ecological nodes, the qualification of becoming a node can be obtained through RPG Staking.

Under this sound economic circulation, PRG has the following distribution principles:

- ``Investors(10%):`` Unlocked within 400 days, equal unlock (claim) each day;

- ``The Core team (14%):`` Core developers and maintainers, 8% of the remaining amount is released every 180 days;

- ``Incubators and consultants (7%):`` Incubators and strategic partners, 8% of the remaining amount is released every 180 days;

- ``Ecological community (49%):`` 8% of the remaining amount is released every 180 days, the ecological community is divided into the proposal and verification nodes. Proposal nodes (35%): join through RPG-staking election and provide special hardware. Verification nodes (14%): stake RPG, and provide required hardware.

- ``Ecological fund (20%):`` The unused amount is locked and relevant announcements made on the foundation website upon use.

- ``Treasury (0%):`` Reward and penalty pool, dynamically balanced during operation, the value can be adjusted by community voting. It includes the penalty (Slash) and taxation mechanisms.

Minimum hardware requirements for mining exploration

- ``CPU：`` *core8*

- ``RAM:`` *16G*

- ``HDD:`` *1T*

- ``Network:`` *100M bandwidth*
